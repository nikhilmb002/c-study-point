		 		Switch-case
				-----------

switch statement is a control statement that provides a concise way to handle mutliple cases based on the value of an expression.

syntax :

	switch(expression){

		case constant1:

			// code to be executed if expression matches constant1 

			break;

		case constant2: 

			// code to be executed if expression matches constant2		
			
			break;

		default: 

			// code to be executed if expression doesn;t match any case

	}



* the value in the switch must be an integer or character.

* use break statements to prevent unintended code flow.

* the default case is optional but often helpful.
