				while
				-----

A 'while' loop in a c programming repeats a block of code as long as specified condition is true. The loop first checks the condition, executes the code if the condition is true, and then re-evaluated the condition, continuing until the condition becomes false.


syntax : 

	while(condition){

		//code to be repeated

	}


	the condition is checked before entering the loop.

	if the condition is true, the code inside the loop runs.

	after the code, the condition is checked again.

	if still true, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.
