				for Loop
				--------

for loop is designed for iterating a specific number of times.

syntax : 

	for(initialization; condition; updation){
	
		//code to be repeated	

	}

example : 

	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	
		printf("\%d ", i); // 0 1 2 3 4 
	}




dummy for loop : 

	for(initialization; condition; updation);

a dummy or empty for loop is  a concept where a for loop structure is used without any meaningful content inside its body.




Initialization : sets the loop control variable to an initial value

Condition : loop continues while the condition is true.
		
	    terminates when the condition becomes false

updation : expression executed after each iteration 

			often used to increment or decrement loop control variables.
