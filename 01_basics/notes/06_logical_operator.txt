Logical operator
---------------

These operators will not modify the operands. so we can supply the operands as constants or variables.

All these operators will give the result either 0 or 1.

example:  && || !




	A		B		A&&B

	0		0		 0

	0		1		 0

	1		0		 0

	1		1		 1


	A		B		A||B

	0		0		 0

	0		1		 1

	1		0		 1

	1		1		 1


		
		A		!A

		0		 1

		1		 0



In logical and if the first operand is 0, compiler will not check the second operand directly gives the result as zero.

In logical or if the first operand is 1, compiler willnot check the second operand, directly gives the result as zero.
