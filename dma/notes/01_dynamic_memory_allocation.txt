Dynamic memory allocation
-------------------------
* it is used as runtime memory allocation

* C programming is supporting to allocation memory in such a way that based on users requirement user can allocate, user can increase, decrease as well as user can deallocate memory with the help of few predefined functions.

	malloc()

	calloc()

	realloc()

	free()


* malloc and calloc functions are used to allocate dynamic memory in heap section 

* realloc function is used to reallocate (increment or decrement, previously allocated)

* free function is used to deallocate previously allocated dynamic memory



* malloc and calloc function used to allocate dynamic memory in a heap and it returns dynamically allocated memory base address.

* to deal with dynamically allocated memory pointer is must, we cannot handle dynamically allocated memory without using pointer.



#include<stdio.h>

#include<stdlib.h>

void main(){

	int *p;

	p = malloc(sizeof(int));

	printf("Enter one integer : ");

	scanf("%d", &p);

	printf("\n%d\n", *p);	
}

// In above program 8 byte memory is allocated statically and 4 byte memory dynamically.
