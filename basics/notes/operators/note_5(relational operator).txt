Relational operator
-------------------

All these operators will not modify the operands. So we can supply the operands as constants or variables.

        All these operators result is either 0 or 1.

 In logical and if the first operand is 0, compiler will not check the second operand  directly gives the result as zero.

        In logical or if the first operand is 1, compiler will not check the
second operand  directly gives the result as one.


example : > >= < <= == !=
