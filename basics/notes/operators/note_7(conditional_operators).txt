Conditional operator
-------------------

also called as ternary operator


syntax: 

	op1 ? op2 : op3;


this operator is called as basic if and else. The result of this operator is either op2 or op3 depends up on op1.

if op1 is a non zero then the result is op2.

else if op1 is not a non zero  then the result is op3.

else if op1 = 0 then the result is op3.

in the place of op2 and op3 we can call function also.


example: 

	{
		int i = 10, j = 20, k;

		k = i < j ? 100 : 200;
		
		printf("k = %d\n", k); // k = 100 

	}
