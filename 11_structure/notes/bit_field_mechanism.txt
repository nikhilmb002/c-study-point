Bit field mechanism
-------------------

allocation of memory for variable in the form of bits is called as bit field mechanism.

syntax : 

	datatype variable_name : no.of bits;

* bitfield variable must and should be within the structure or union.

* try to make bit field variable unsigned type so that all the bits acts as data bits.

* there is  no any specifi format specifier available for bit field.

* bit field cannot be float or double.

* & operator not applicable on bit field

* size of operator is not applicable on bit field.
