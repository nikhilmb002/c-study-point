Structure padding
-----------------

* structure padding is compiler dependent process.

* If processor is a 8 bit then it can fetch 1 byte at a time, similiarly 32 bit processor can fetch 4 bytes at a time, based on this when memory is allocated 4 or more than 4. Compiler request to OS to allocate a memory in the multiple of 4 bytes to increase the speed of execution and processing.




Allocation of extra bytes for structure variable as per the required one. This concept is called as a structure padding. This extra bytes are treated as a holes in structure.


How to avoid structure padding ?

* Keep similiar types of data together to avoid structure padding or another way is we can take help of preprocessor directive #pragma

	
	example : 

		#pragma pack(1)
