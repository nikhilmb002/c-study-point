				Goto
				----

Goto is an unconditional  non iterative control statement.

Goto is also called as local goto(within one function we need to use).


Goto can be used in 2 different ways

1. Forward goto

	if we call the goto first and below if we set the label, it acts as forward goto.
	

2. Backward goto

	if we set the label first and then call the label next, it act as backward goto


The syntax of goto contains 2 parts

1. Setting label

2. Calling that label


syntax of setting label : 

			Label_name: 


example : 

	L1 : 

syntax to call that label : 


			goto Label_name;


example : 

	goto L1;



setting the label and calling the label must be within the function.
