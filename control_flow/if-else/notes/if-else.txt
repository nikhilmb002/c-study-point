				if - else
				---------

* if - else statements is used for decision-making purpose.

* it allows the execution of different code blocks based on a specified condition.



syntax : 

	if(condition){
	
		// code to execute if condition is true
	}

	else{
		
		// code to execute if condition is false
	
	}

example : 

	if(num % 2 == 0)

		printf("number is even");

	else
		printf("number is odd");



if the code block associated with 'if' or 'else' consists of only one statement, the curly braces '{}' are optional.


if-else statement can be nested, allowing for multiple levels of decision making.


multiple conditions can be checked in sequence using 'else if' blocks

syntax : 

	if(condition1){

		// code for condition1

	}

	else if(condition2){
	
		// code for conditon2

	}

	else{

		// code if all conditions are false

	}


if - else statement ensures that only one block of code is executed, based on the first true condition encountered.


for simple 'if-else' constructs with single expression in each block , the ternary operator ' ? : ' provides a concise alternative.

else block is optional
