Continue
--------

continue statement is a jump statement used within loops(for, while, do-while) in c. It's used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and jump directly to the next iteration.


Working
-------

*When continue is encountered within a loop, the program control jumps back to the beginning of the current iteration.

* Any remaining code in the current iteration is skipped.

* The loop condition is evaluated again to determine if another iteration should occur.


Use cases
---------

* Skipping specific values	

* conditional processing


syntax : 

	continue;


example :


	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	
		if(i % 2 == 0)

			continue;

		printf("%d is odd\n", i);
	}	




* continue only affects the loop it's within.
