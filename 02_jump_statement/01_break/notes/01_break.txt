Break
-----

The break statement is a jump statement used in c to terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely. It causes the program to exit the loop.


Use cases
---------

* Exiting a loop upon a specific condition 

	This is a common scenario where we want the loop to continue iterating until a certain condition is met. Once the condition is true, we cane use break to exit the loop.

* Exiting nested loop

	break cane be used to exit inner loops even if the outer loop's condition hasn't been satisfied yet.


Syntax : 

	break;



break can only exit the loop or switch statement it's directly within.


example : 

	
	switch (op){

		case  1 : printf("sunday\n"); break;

		case  2 : printf("Monday\n"); break;

		default : printf("Invalid\n"); break;


	}
