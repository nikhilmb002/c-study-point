return
------

The return statement serves two primary purposes

1. Terminating a function : When a function encounters a return statement, the function's execution immediately stops, and control is transferred back to the calling function.


2. Returning a value (optional) : The return statement can optionally be followed by an expression. This expression is evaluated, and value is returned to the calling function.


Syntax :

	return [expression];




* [expression] part is optional. If omitted, the function returns nothing and indicates succesfull exection by returning 0;


Return types
------------

* Every function in c must have a declared return type, which specifies the kind of data of the function can return (eg : int, float, void).

* The datatype of the expression within the return statement must be compatible with the function's declared return type.



example : 


	void printHello(){

		printf("Hello\n");

		return; //optional return in void functions
	}
