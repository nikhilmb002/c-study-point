What is single linked list ?

A single linked list is a type of linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in a sequence. Each node contains 2 parts.

	1. Data: The actual value or data stored in the node
	2. Next: A reference to the next node in the list. That last node points to null 

Why using a single linked list ?

* Dynamic size: Unlike arrays, linked list do not require a predefined size. The list can grow or shrink as needed.

* Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, can be more efficient compared to arrays because there's no need to shift elements


Basic terminology
-----------------

Head: The first node in the list
Tail: The last node, which points to null
Node: The basic element that holds the data and the reference to the next node
Traversal: The process of visiting each node in the list one by one
